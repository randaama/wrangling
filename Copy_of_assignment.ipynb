        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - This paper is about what a tidy dataset is, how it is structured, and how to change a messy data set into a tidy data set.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - The tidy data standard is intended to make it easier for data to be cleaned, because it gives guidance on how to change a data set into a form that makes its data easier to analyze, which will keep people from having to figure it out themselves.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    - I think this means that tidy datasets are all similar because they are structured the same way, but data sets that are messy can be messy in a multitude of different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "  What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    - This means that it is difficult to figure out how to group variables with each other because they have different attributes that may be related or unrelated to each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - A value is a number or a string, basically what is inputted in each cell of a data set\n",
        "    - A variable is an object that conatins all the values that are measured from the same attribute (like all ages in a group of people) across units\n",
        "    - An observation is all the values measured across every variable for one unit\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Tidy data is a dataset in which every variable is its own column, every observation is a row, and each unot forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "      - The 5 most common problems are column headers being values and not variable names, multiple variables being stored in one column, variables being stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units being stored in one table, and single observational units being stord in multiple tables.\n",
        "      \n",
        "      - The data is table 4 is messy, because each column aside from religion is a value of the same variable (income bracket). Melting a dataset is essentially turning columns into rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Table 11 is messy, because there is a separate column for every possible day in a month, instead of all the days being in one column. Table 12 is tidy, because the dates and their values have been condensed into 3 variables (for 12a), which allows for easier processing of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "      - The chicken and egg problem is that if tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, the tools will be forever associated with tidy data. So basically, if we just stick with this structure of tidy data because it works, we may be limiting ourselves to just this structure when other ways could work better. He hopes that methods can be used to understand the more human side of data wrangling in the future and lead to more adaptability of tools.\n",

When changing it to numeric, almost half of the data in the variable was missing values, which is a lot of data to lose. So I looked at the type of sentence compared to the missing values in the length variable to see if there was a pattern between the kind of sentence and the length. The majority of the missing values were in 4 category of sentence kind, so I replaced all the missing values for the observations that wee in the 4 category with 0 and the rest of the missing values (in the 9 category) with nan's.
